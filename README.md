# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier for Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains code for building a Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier to predict wine quality based on various features. The dataset used for training and testing the classifier contains information about different wines, including chemical properties and sensory quality ratings.


### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, Cuml, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Quality_Analysis_with_Gaussian_Naive_Bayes.ipynb`.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell sequentially. The notebook guides you through the following steps:
   - Loading the dataset
   - Preprocessing the data
   - Training the GNB classifier
   - Evaluating the classifier's performance on validation and test sets
   - Visualizing the results and performance metrics
4. The notebook also includes visualizations of the classifier's predictions and performance metrics for both validation and test sets.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is available in the file `reduced_data.csv`. It includes various features related to wine composition and quality ratings.
